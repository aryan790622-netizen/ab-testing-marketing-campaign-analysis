# 📊 Marketing Campaign A/B Testing & Performance Analysis

## 🔎 Project Overview

This project evaluates and compares the performance of two digital advertising campaigns — Facebook Ads and Google AdWords — using statistical testing, data analysis, and predictive modeling.

The objective is to identify the higher-performing platform, understand the relationship between user engagement and conversions, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve marketing return on investment (ROI).

This project demonstrates how data analysts use statistical methods and business reasoning to support real marketing decisions.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Marketing teams must allocate advertising budgets efficiently across multiple platforms. Without statistical validation, campaign decisions may rely on assumptions rather than measurable performance.

**Objective:**
Determine which advertising platform performs better and quantify how engagement (clicks) influences conversion outcomes.

**Key business questions:**

* Which campaign generates more conversions?
* Is the performance difference statistically significant?
* Can conversions be predicted from clicks?
* How consistent is campaign performance over time?

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains daily performance data for Facebook and AdWords campaigns throughout 2019 (365 observations).

### Key variables:

* Date
* Ad views
* Clicks
* Conversions
* Click-through rate (CTR)
* Conversion rate
* Cost per click (CPC)
* Cost per ad
